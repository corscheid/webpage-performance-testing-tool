# webpage-performance-testing-tool

What this program *currently* does is open a Firefox window, and test the performance of Google.com and then email the results, all automatically using one command in a terminal.

## Usage

`$ ruby test.rb`

## Configuration file

`config.yaml` contains relevant values used by the program. They are all fairly self-explanatory:

`to_addr`: the email address to send the results to

`username`: your gmail username (your gmail address or Gsuite address)

`password`: your gmail/Gsuite password

### More coming soon...
